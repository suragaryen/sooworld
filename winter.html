    Winter is the coldest season of the year in polar and temperate climates. <br>It occurs after autumn and before spring. The tilt of Earth's axis causes seasons; winter occurs <br>when a hemisphere is oriented away from the Sun. Different cultures define different dates as<br> the start of winter, and some use a definition based on weather.
